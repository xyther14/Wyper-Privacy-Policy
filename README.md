Privacy Policy for Wyper Weather App

This app is a minimal weather app which uses the OpenWeatherAPI to fetch weather information either by using location of the device or by manually searching for a city name. When the user allows location access, the app fetches the device geolocation and calls the OpenWeather API to get the weather information.

The app also has a widget to display the quirky images on the home screen which is taken from the app itself. The widget refreshes the next time you open the app again.
