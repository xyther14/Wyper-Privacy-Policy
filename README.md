Privacy Policy for Wyper Weather App

This app is a minimal weather app which uses the OpenWeatherAPI to fetch weather information either by using location of the device or by manually searching for a city name. No data is stored or transferred anywhere.

The app also has a widget to display the quirky images on the home screen which is taken from the app itself. The widget refreshes the next time you open the app again.

Your data is yours, as it should be.
